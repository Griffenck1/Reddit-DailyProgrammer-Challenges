Challenge Summary:

The puropse of this challenge was to take a any integer and 
re-arrange its digits to find the next largest integer. This
was a simple challenge and I used it to improve the quality
of my c++ code (I stopped using namespace std; at the top 
of my files and implemented better methods to catch errors).
