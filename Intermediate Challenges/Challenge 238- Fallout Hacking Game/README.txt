Challenge Summary:

The purpose of this challenge was to create a word matching game like the one found when hacking in fallout. 
Depending on the difficulty the program gives you a set number of words of a set length. You must try and 
guess the "correct" word. When an incorrect word is guessed the game will inform you how many of the 
positions within the word you got correct until you either guess correctly or run out of tries.
