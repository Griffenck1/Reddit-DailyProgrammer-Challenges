Challenge Summary:

This is a short challenge meant to help me get started in Java. For this challenge I created 3 classes that 
each ask for the user to imput a number with 2-4 digits. largestDigit.java then prints the largest digit 
of the input, descendingOrder.java prints the input sorted in descening order. kaprekarsRoutine.java 
takes the input and subtracts the input in ascending order from the input in descending order until the 
number stays the same, it keeps track of how many times it has to do this in order for the number to
remain the same and then prints how many times it took.
